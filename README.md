## About the project

<p align="justify"><strong>AIssistant</strong> is a website with a simple <i>intelligent assistant</i> that helps you with your daily duties and important tasks. You can translate text, generate recipes or answers questions based on a topic you want</p>

<p align="justify">The project is divided in two main parts, which are the server side and the client side. I use React with NextJS and its API, and the OpenAI and Gemini API for content and image generation</p>

## Requisites
If you want to clone the project, you'll just need the following programs and commands:
  
  - NodeJS (v20.11.1 recommended)
  - Write `npm install` in a console to run the client and server project to install dependencies
  - Write `npm run dev` in a console to run the client and server project in development mode
